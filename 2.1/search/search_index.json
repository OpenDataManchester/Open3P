The goal of Open 3P is to establish a common language for exchanging and sharing data related to packaging materials and processes, which will help to improve transparency and accountability in the industry.</p> <p>With Open 3P, stakeholders in the packaging supply chain will be able to share information about materials, components and packaging in a standardised format. This will allow for better collaboration between manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, regulators, and consumers. By creating a common understanding of the materials and processes involved in packaging, it will be easier to identify opportunities for reducing waste, increasing efficiency, and improving sustainability throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>The first phase of the project brought together stakeholders from the entire packaging ecosystem to explore how we might create the foundations for systemic change in the packaging value chain. We had more than 120 individuals from over 70 organisations take part in our workshops, interviews and research and we are incredibly grateful to them for sharing their time, expertise and support.</p> <p>Open 3P is based on the principles of open data, which means that it is freely accessible, sharable, and usable by anyone. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts and use cases, so that it can evolve over time as new technologies and practices emerge. The development of Open 3P is guided by the OpenStand principles of:</p> <ul> <li>Due process</li> <li>Broad consensus</li> <li>Transparency</li> <li>Balance</li> <li>Openness</li> </ul> <p>which ensure that the standard is developed in a fair and inclusive manner, and that all stakeholders have a voice in the process.</p> <p>Overall, Open 3P represents an important step forward for the packaging industry, as it provides a foundation for greater transparency and collaboration across the supply chain. By adopting a common language for sharing and exchanging data, stakeholders will be able to work together more effectively to reduce waste, improve sustainability, and create a more circular economy.</p>"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_1_Introduction/#how-to-use-the-standard","title":"How to use the standard","text":"<p>To use the Open 3P standard, start by familiarising yourself with the terms and definitions outlined in the standard.

In a supply chain, different companies and people work together to get products from where they\u2019re made to where they\u2019re sold.</p> <p>There are various steps in the supply chain:</p> <ul> <li>Getting Materials: It starts with getting the materials needed to make something, like a car or a phone. These materials might come from different places around the world.</li> <li>Making Stuff: Then, companies use those materials to make the actual product. For example, a car company takes metal, plastic, and other parts to build cars.</li> <li>Moving Things Around: Once the product is made, it needs to get to the stores or customers who want to buy it. This involves shipping and transportation, which can involve trucks, ships, planes, and more.</li> <li>Selling and Supporting: Finally, the product gets to the stores or customers, who buy it. But the process doesn\u2019t end there. Companies often provide support, like customer service or repairs, to make sure customers are happy with their purchase.</li> </ul> <p>Key componets of an efficient and effective supply chain are:</p> <ul> <li>Collaboration: Different companies and people along the supply chain need to work together smoothly. If one part of the chain breaks down, it can slow everything down. For example, if a supplier can\u2019t deliver materials on time, it can delay production.</li> <li>Interoperability: This means making sure all the different parts of the supply chain can work together seamlessly. For example, the computer systems used by suppliers should be able to communicate with the systems used by manufacturers and retailers. If they can\u2019t, it can cause errors and delays.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_2_Key_Concepts/#the-packaging-supply-chain","title":"The packaging supply chain","text":"<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the supply chain for packaging, which is essential for protecting products and getting them safely to customers:</p> <ol> <li>Material Sourcing:<ul> <li>The supply chain for packaging starts with the sourcing of raw materials. These materials can include paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, metal, and various other materials used for packaging.</li> <li>Suppliers gather these materials from different sources, which could be forests for paper, oil refineries for plastics, mines for metals, or recycling facilities for recycled materials.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Manufacturing:<ul> <li>Once the raw materials are sourced, they are sent to manufacturing facilities where they are turned into packaging materials. For example, paper pulp is processed into cardboard boxes, plastic pellets are molded into bottles or bags, and metal sheets are shaped into cans.</li> <li>These manufacturing processes involve machinery, specialised equipment, and skilled labor to produce packaging materials in large quantities.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Packaging Design and Printing:<ul> <li>Some packaging may require additional steps for design and printing. This can involve graphic design, branding, and printing of logos, product information, and marketing messages on the packaging.</li> <li>Printing facilities or specialised packaging design companies handle this aspect of the supply chain, ensuring that the packaging meets both functional and aesthetic requirements.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Distribution and Logistics:<ul> <li>Once the packaging materials are manufactured and printed, they need to be distributed to the companies that will use them to package their products.</li> <li>This involves transportation and logistics networks to move the packaging materials from manufacturing facilities to warehouses and distribution centers, where they are stored until needed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Usage by Manufacturers:<ul> <li>Manufacturers of consumer goods, food and beverage products, pharmaceuticals, and other products use the packaging materials to package their products.</li> <li>They integrate the packaging into their production processes, filling bottles, wrapping products, or placing items into boxes before they are ready for distribution.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Retail Distribution:<ul> <li>Finished products with packaging are then distributed to retailers or directly to customers through various channels such as brick-and-mortar stores, online marketplaces, or wholesalers.</li> <li>Packaging plays a crucial role in protecting products during transportation and storage, as well as attracting customers\u2019 attention on store shelves.</li> </ul> </li> <li>End-of-Life Management:<ul> <li>Finally, after the products are consumed, the packaging enters the end-of-life stage. Depending on the material, packaging may be recycled, reused, composted, or disposed of in landfills.</li> <li>Recycling facilities, waste management companies, and government programs handle the disposal or recycling of packaging materials, closing the loop of the packaging supply chain.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Throughout this supply chain, collaboration and interoperability are essential to ensure that packaging materials are sourced sustainably, manufactured efficiently, and used effectively to protect products and minimise environmental impact.</p>"},{"location":"1_Start_Here/1_2_Key_Concepts/#supply-chain-products-waste-flows","title":"Supply Chain, Products, Waste Flows","text":"<p>The diagram below can help you to visualise how information might flow across the packaging supply chain. <pre><code>sequenceDiagram\n    participant manufacturers\n    participant brands\n    participant retailers\n    participant consumers\n    participant recyclers\n    participant complianceSchemes \n    participant regulators\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;brands: products\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;retailers: products\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;complianceSchemes: data\n    manufacturers-&gt;&gt;regulators: data\n    brands-&gt;&gt;retailers: products\n    brands-&gt;&gt;consumers: products\n    brands-&gt;&gt;recyclers: waste\n    brands-&gt;&gt;complianceSchemes: data\n    brands-&gt;&gt;regulators: data\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;consumers: products\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;recyclers: waste\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;complianceSchemes: data\n    retailers-&gt;&gt;regulators: data\n    consumers-&gt;&gt;recyclers: waste\n    recyclers-&gt;&gt;manufacturers: material\n    complianceSchemes-&gt;&gt;regulators: data</code></pre> The diagram hows the complexity of the packaging supply chain.

It is a Community Interest Company (CIC) that has an \u2018asset lock\u2019, a legal mechanism that prevents predatory take over of its assets by third parties.</p> <p>ODM\u2019s role as the DSHB is four-fold.</p> <ul> <li>It holds the standard in an asset-lock.</li> <li>It develops and maintains the standard on behalf of the Standard Custodian Board (SCB).</li> <li>It provides secretariat services to the SCB.</li> <li>It provides support services to individuals and organisations that want to adopt and exploit the potential of the data standard.</li> </ul> <p>The SCB ensures that the standard is developed for and on-behalf of the packaging value chain. The board consists of industry stakeholders, domain and technical experts and is chaired by ODM. The board is elected through an open process with board members holding post for a maximum of three continuous years before stepping down.</p> <p>Development of the standard follows a strict governance process where changes are either submitted to the board through the DSHB, the SCB itself or through external petition. Changes are assessed and if deemed to be beneficial are circulated for consultation. After the consultation period expires, the changes are then re-assessed and adopted if agreed. The SCB then mandates the DSHB to implement the change.</p> <p>All proceedings and documents relating to the governance arrangements of the Open 3P standard can be found on the Governance Proceedings page of the Open 3P website. Meetings are quarterly with agenda, related documents circulated to the board 30 days before the meeting.</p>"},{"location":"9_Change_Log/8_1_Change_Log/","title":"Latest Updates","text":"<p>A document that contains all the changes made to the standard.</p>"},{"location":"9_Change_Log/8_1_Change_Log/#january-31-2024","title":"January 31, 2024","text":""},{"location":"9_Change_Log/8_1_Change_Log/#documents","title":"Documents","text":"<ul> <li>Updated JSON examples to match data flow page.
