# Complete Packaging

The complete packaging schema contains information regarding the complete packages that are used to create loads. These maybe created from a single component or a combination of components from the components schema.

## Table
|Column|<div style="width:90px">Status</div>|Format|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|identifier|`required`|String|A globally unique identifier. See [identifiers](../4_Identifiers/4_1_Identifiers.md) section for information on how to construct this identifier|

|description|`recommended`|String|A brief description of this complete packaging.|
|externalIdentifiers|`recommended`|Dictionary|A dictionary of identifiers that might be used to identify the complete packaging in other systems.

To provide external identifiers please follow this format. `{'externalIdentifierName1': 'identifier1', 'externalIdentifierName2': 'identifier2'}`|

Complete packaging should be provided as a separate csv file, in tidy format. This means that each row of the csv file should be one complete package of a load. An example is provided.

The specification of this csv file is as follows:

## Guide for how to take measurements

### Units

All measurements should be given using the metric system.

- Height: millimetre (mm)
- Width: millimetre (mm)
- Length: millimetre (mm)
- Volume: cubic metre (m3)
- Weight: grams (g)
- servingCapacity: grams (g)

Numbers should be entered with a decimal place, a space between the number, and the unit as specified above. Use the decimal / full stop / period character as a separator. For example: volume = 20.000 mm3. Do not exceed 3 decimal places.

**Important**: When converting between systems of measurement, perform the conversion first and then apply rounding. This will give more accuracy and consistency.

### Default Front of a complete packaging
As with taking and reporting measurements for components, we use the [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/){target=_blank} method for taking measurements. Now, with all the components put together to form the complete packaging, first find the default front, the the face with the largest area, where area is equal to the width times the height.

- The side with the maximum area then becomes the default front of that complete packaging.

### Measuring the height, width, and depth of a complete packaging
After the default front has been determined, it is possible to determine the height, width, and depth of the complete packaging. Please follow the measurement guidelines provided by [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-package-and-product-measurement-standard/current-standard#4-Consumer-(end-user)-trade-items+4-3-Determining-the-height,-width-and-depth){target=_blank}


## Guide for complete packaging images
As with providing measurements, please first find the default front of the complete packaging. The image capturing process and naming convention is similar to [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-product-image-specification-standard/current-standard#1-Introduction){target=_blank}.
