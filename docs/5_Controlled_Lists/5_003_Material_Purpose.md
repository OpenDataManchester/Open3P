# Material Purpose

The material purpose controlled list identifies the purpose of this material in this combination of [material constituents](../6_Relationship_Lists/6_001_Material_Constituents.md).

**Controlled lists are maintained by the SCB, if there are values that you believe need to be added then [contact us](https://www.open3p.org/contact/) and we can add new values to the lists.**
